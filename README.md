👋 Hi, I’m Elinam Grey

🎓 I studied Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT), Tarkwa, Ghana<br/>
📊 I’m currently learning Python for Data Science and Machine Learning, with a focus on understanding how data can be used to solve real-world problems<br/>
🧠 I use my projects here to practice core concepts like data cleaning, analysis, basic modeling, and logical problem solving<br/>
🛠️ Most of my work is hands-on and exploratory, built as part of my learning journey rather than polished production systems<br/>
📁 Each repository represents a specific problem I tried to understand, the approach I took, and what I learned from it<br/>
📈 Over time, these projects reflect my growth in Python, SQL, data analysis, and machine learning fundamentals<br/>
🚀 My goal is to keep improving through consistent practice and gradually build stronger, more structured projects<br/>
